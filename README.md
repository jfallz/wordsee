# wordsee
Get a visualization of a long piece of text based on words and phrases.

## Usage:

wordsee.py [-w #ofwords] [-fn filename.ext]

[-w #ofwords] example:
"wordsee.py -w 3" will display analytics for substrings of size 1, 2, and 3 from the text. This number is how many total plots you will receive.

[-fn filename.ext] example:
"wordsee.py -fn fileIn.txt" will use fileIn.txt for the current plots. This is so you can have multiple text files and once without constantly replacing the text.
